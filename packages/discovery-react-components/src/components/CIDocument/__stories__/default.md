#### Overview

The CIDocument component provides Element Classification to the user. It takes a PDF and enrich it with features a customer might deem important (such as obligation, Deliverables, Assignments, etc...). This would help a customer get a better understanding of their document or help them find what they need in a large document in a more efficient way.
