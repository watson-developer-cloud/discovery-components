#### Overview

The `StructuredQuery` component is used to visually build structured queries against your project. In this component, it's possible to select rules that need to be followed. Each rule is composed of a field from your project and whether it is, is not, contains, or does not contain a specific value.

There are top-level rules for which it's possible to choose whether all or any of them must be satisfied. If the query needs to be more granular, it is also possible to add rule groups, which nest additional sets of rules within them. For these rule groups, you can also choose whether all or any of them must be satisfied.

The query that corresponds to the rules and rule groups that are selected is displayed at the bottom of the component. As rules and rule groups are built out in the component, the query will continue to update to match. It's possible to copy the query by clicking the icon next to it.
