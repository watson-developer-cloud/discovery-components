In such circumstances, the provisions of Clauses 9.7 to 9.8 shall apply. 9.7 Upon receiving notification from the Supplier under Clause 9.6 above, the parties’ Relationship Managers shall convene as soon as practicable onto discuss all aspects of the relevant circumstances including (i) the failure of the Dependency and/or Force Majeure Event and its effect on the Supplier's ability to achieve the relevant Key Milestone by any applicable Milestone Date; (ii) any workaround or other action necessary to mitigate the failure of any Dependency; and (iii) the appropriate relief (if any) which should be afforded to Supplier, which may include an extension to one or more of the Milestone Dates within the Timetable.

Where, following any such six monthly review, Buyer determines that changes are required to the then current Exit Plan, the Supplier shall, within 30 days following any request by Buyer to do so, incorporate such changes into the Exit Plan and shall submit the revised Exit Plan to Buyer for Buyer's approval. The approval process set out in Clauses 31.7(b) to 31.7(d) shall apply to the approval of any revised Exit Plan submitted to Buyer pursuant to this Clause 31.7(e) (with all references to the \"draft exit plan\" in Clauses 31.7(b) to 31.7(d) being deemed to be references to such revised Exit Plan for the purpose of this Clause 31.7(e)). 32.0 Record Keeping, Audit Rights and Regulatory Assistance 32.1, The Supplier shall: a) keep and maintain Records in accordance with; and b) retain such Records for such period as is consistent with, prudent and good industry standards within the IT products and services industry.

The Supplier agrees to cooperate fully with such audits. The Supplier shall be entitled to require, as a condition of allowing such access, an Audit Right Holder to enter into confidentiality undertakings (which are consistent with and no more stringent than the confidentiality undertakings under Clause 22.7 (Exchange of Information)) in respect of, and to be supervised during, such access, provided that it is permissible under Relevant Laws for Buyer, Customer and the Supplier to require this as a condition of such access. If the audit access provided under Clause 32.2 reveals any non-compliances by the Supplier of the Agreement, then, 32.3 without limiting any other rights or remedies of Buyer the Supplier agrees and undertakes to remedy such non-compliances. 32.4 If any audit reveals any overcharging by the Supplier on any invoice(s), an appropriate correcting credit shall be made within fourteen (14) days of such overcharge being identified.
