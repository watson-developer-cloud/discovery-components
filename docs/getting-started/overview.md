## About Discovery Components

A collection of React components used to interact with the IBM Watson Discovery service on CloudPakForData.

When you connect the components from this library to your IBM Watson Discovery project, you will be able to search and display results from that project within your own application. If you are new to Discovery Components, you can check out the [example app](#example-app-examplesdiscovery-search-app) included in this repo, take a look at our instructions for integrating Discovery Components with a [new](#setting-up-discovery-components-in-a-new-application) or [existing application](#setting-up-discovery-components-in-an-existing-application), or interact with our components on [storybook](https://watson-developer-cloud.github.io/discovery-components/storybook/).
